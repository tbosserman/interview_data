This just contains some sample data for an interview question:
        Network IP Address Lookup.

The question is:

Write a program which takes an IP address and looks in a table to find a contact for that IP address.

While the sample data above does not reflect it, the netblocks in the file could overlap so a  “longest match” algorithm must be implemented.

The program should ask the user to type an IP address, lookup that address and print out the net block and contact.

The input file may have comments. Comments start with “#”. Individual lines may also have trailing comments. See the above sample data for examples.
